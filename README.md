loci: Two columns, the first column is the marker name, and the second column is the corresponding phenotype.
phe: A phenotype matrix where each row represents the phenotype values for each inbred line, and each column represents a specific phenotype value across different inbred lines.
geo: A genotype matrix where each row represents an inbred line, and each column represents a marker.
